Why selling? (FYI: you don't need to read this...)
I have a progressive eye disease that is taking my sight.  To see my laptop screen I must wear magnifiers on my glasses and also use the zoom feature in iOX.  I have to set my iPhone to the highest font setting.  Granddaughter thought my iPhone needed a bath in the dog's water bowl and can not be repaired.  I need to move to an iPad with Wifi+Cellular as my phone.  Selling my MacBook Pro is the only way to do this.
